# Work Automation Server

This is the source code for the Work Automation server I developed over months working at a Logistics company.
It is designed to provide utility functions to me in the form of a web interface, as well as automate processing certain reports.

## Installation

Dependencies can be installed by

`npm install`

## Starting the server

The main server is contained in server/server.js, and can be started with

`node server/server.js`

The server requires a config file `config.json` generated and placed alongside `server.js`.
